Description: The memkind library is an user extensible heap manager built on top of
 jemalloc which enables control of memory characteristics and a
 partitioning of the heap between kinds of memory. The kinds of memory
 are defined by operating system memory policies that have been applied
 to virtual address ranges. Memory characteristics supported by
 memkind without user extension include control of NUMA and page size
 features. The jemalloc non-standard interface has been extended to
 enable specialized arenas to make requests for virtual memory from the
 operating system through the memkind partition interface. Through the
 other memkind interfaces the user can control and extend memory
 partition features and allocate memory while selecting enabled
 features. This software is being made available for early evaluation.
 Feedback on design or implementation is greatly appreciated.
